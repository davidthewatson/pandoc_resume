Software engineer manifesting novel ideas in emerging technology products and services  
My passion is learning by creating, producing, and reflecting. Some call it action learning.
A computer science award enabled me to pivot my education as a music school dropout. 
Finished the  BS at night as a data center programming  internship ignited my love for software. 

Honed my craft automating operations, developing user interfaces, and managing Unix systems. 

As the Unix sun set on my early career, the  Linux sun rose on a fellowship catalyzing my startup.
Roles followed from rapid prototyping to automated deployment to remodeling MVP→MAYA: Minimum Viable Products→Most Advanced Yet Acceptable.

My management roles are best described as moderator to the middle road from conflict to consensus. Moving consensus from possible to probable is sensemaking, whether it was  agile, lean, or scrumban.
